# PanPipe

pipeline.pl -- A perl script for pan-genome.

ABSTRACT:

We report here a one step pipeline to perform pan genome construction. This pipeline employing a novel approach 
uses raw reads as input, collapsing them and generating contigs so as to give maximum genome coverage.

IMPLEMENTATION:

The single script pipeline (pipeline.pl) integrates multiple perl scripts. Users have to download the zipped file
and execute pipeline.pl making changes according to their requirement as suggested in the script pipeline.pl.
